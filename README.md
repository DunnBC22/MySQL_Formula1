# MySQL_Formula1

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/davidcochran/formula-1-race-data-sqlite.

This dataset was originally a SQLite3, so I transferred it to MySQL. I was able to export the database schema to a sql file to run in MySQL. I had to make some updates for most of the tables in order to import them. I used the SQL import scripts (that I included) for most of the tables. Some of them required additional work, so I just used the Import Wizard within MySQL Workbench to import the other tables.

Additionally, my focus was to continue learning more advanced SQL Queries. At the same time, I refreshed my memory about some different topics (which is why some of the queries are very simple). 

I am not completed with this dataset, but I wanted to post what I have so far.
